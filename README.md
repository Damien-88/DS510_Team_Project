Modeling Global Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Using the Big Mac Index

Explore and model PPP through the 2024 Big Mac Index dataset from Kaggle, using machine learning techniques (Linear Regression & Decision Trees) to predict currency valuation and identify factors influencing local Big Mac pricing. The project will compare model performance in terms of accuracy and economic interpretability.
