#### Project Overview

Modeling Global Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Using the Big Mac Index

Goal:
-  Explore and model PPP through the 2024 Big Mac Index dataset from Kaggle, using machine learning techniques (Linear Regression & Decision Trees) to predict currency valuation and identify factors influencing local Big Mac pricing. The project will compare model performance in terms of accuracy and economic interpretability.

#### Meeting Overview

Modeling Focus: 
-  Supervised learning models with emphasis on PPP analysis.

Models Chosen:
-  Linear Regression
-  Decision Trees

Work Division:
-  Each model team will split tasks into Pre-processing/Data Handling and Modeling/Evaluation.
-  Both members of each team will collaborate on Analytics & Interpretation to compare results.

Comparison Goals (All together):
-  Assess strengths and weaknesses of each model.
-  Discuss model-specific advantages and disadvantages in an economic context.

Tools & Workflow:
-  Coding & Modeling: Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab
-  Version Control & Documentation: GitHub repository
